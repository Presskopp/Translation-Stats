Show plugins translation stats on your WordPress install.

== Description ==

The plugin adds a "Translation Stats" column to the plugin list screen in WordPress admin.

The translation stats are shown only for plugins that exist in [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/) and are [prepared for localization](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/).

If a plugin doesn't have complete translation stats, you'll see a notice with one of the reasons below:

*   Plugin not found on WordPress.org
*   Translation project not found on WordPress.org
*   The plugin is not properly prepared for localization

The color scheme of the translation stats bars is exactly same used in [GlotPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/glotpress/) for consistency with the translation experience in [translate.wp.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/).

This plugin is properly prepared for localization.

Since mid-April 2016, not only new strings but also edits are synced between dev and stable (both ways, only approved translations). When a plugin releases a new version all translations are copied from dev to stable.
